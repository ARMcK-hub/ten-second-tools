nSync offers the following features:
- mirror archiving of files using rsync, ACLs not included
- file change logging with execution stats
- force overwrite of special file types like .hc
- regular job storage in form of config file


Also see `RoboMirror` for a similar PowerShell implementation.
>**Note**: nSync works from file checksums while RoboMirror uses Windows PowerShell's Robocopy - which works by filename.
